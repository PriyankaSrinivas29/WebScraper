 Researchers from the Food Packaging Forum identify and discuss nearly 200 potential breast carcinogens that have been detected in food contact materials (FCMs) on the market.. Many nations have food contact material legislation intended to protect citizens from hazardous chemicals, often specifically by regulating genotoxic carcinogens.. As cancer is one of the few health endpoints specifically targeted in FCM regulations and testing, carcinogenic chemicals in food packaging and other food contact materials and articles should not be commonplace..

 Today, the U.. S.. Food and Drug Administration approved FluMist for self- or caregiver-administration.. FluMist is approved for the prevention of influenza disease caused by influenza virus subtypes A and B in individuals 2 through 49 years of age.. FluMist is sprayed into the nose and has been used safely and effectively for many years.. It was initially approved by the FDA in 2003 for use in individuals 5 through 49 years of age, and in 2007, the FDA approved the use of FluMist to include children 2 through 5 years of age..

 Some triptans are a more effective treatment for acute migraines than newer, more expensive drugs, finds an analysis of the latest evidence published by The BMJ.. Triptans work by narrowing blood vessels in the brain and preventing the release of chemicals that cause pain and inflammation.. The findings show that four triptans - eletriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan, and zolmitriptan - were better at relieving migraine pain than the recently marketed and more expensive drugs lasmiditan, rimegepant, and ubrogepant, which were comparable to paracetamol and most anti-inflammatory painkillers (NSAIDs)..

 Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration (U.. S.. FDA) has approved OCREVUS ZUNOVO (ocrelizumab & hyaluronidase-ocsq) for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) and primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS).. OCREVUS ZUNOVO is the first and only twice-a-year, healthcare professional (HCP)-administered approximately 10-minute subcutaneous (SC) injection approved for both these forms of multiple sclerosis, giving people living with MS more treatment options..

 Integral Molecular, a leader in antibody discovery and characterization, has published new research in the journal mAbs, revealing that as many as one-third of antibody-based drugs exhibit nonspecific binding to unintended targets.. A serious concern, off-target drug binding is a significant cause of adverse events in patients, with the potential to even cause death.. Analysis of antibody off-target binding across different phases of clinical development suggests this to be a major cause of drug attrition.. Early specificity testing could improve drug approvals and patient safety.. More than 39 million deaths from antibiotic-resistant infections estimated between now and 2050

 More than 39 million people around the world could die from antibiotic-resistant infections over the next 25 years, according to a study published in The Lancet.. The new study by the Global Research on Antimicrobial Resistance (GRAM) Project is the first global analysis of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) trends over time.. It reveals that more than one million people died each year as a result of AMR between 1990 and 2021.. How the immune system fails as cancer arises

 Cancer has been described as "a wound that does not heal," implying that the immune system is unable to wipe out invading tumor cells.. A new discovery confirms that a key molecule can reprogram immune cells that normally protect against infection and cancer, turning them into bad guys that promote cancer growth.. Studying the behavior of these "pro-tumor" immune cells is important because they could be targets for therapies that block their harmful activity, said Minsoo Kim, PhD, corresponding author of the study and a research leader at the Wilmot Cancer Institute..

 Laughter may be as effective as eye drops in improving symptoms of dry eye disease, finds a clinical trial from China published by The BMJ.. The researchers suggest that laughter exercise could be an initial treatment for relieving symptoms of dry eye disease.. Dry eye disease (DED) is a chronic condition estimated to affect around 360 million individuals worldwide..

 Bothnia dystrophy is a form of hereditary blindness, prevalent in the region Vsterbotten in Sweden.. A new study at Karolinska Institutet published in Nature Communications shows that gene therapy can improve vision in patients with the disease.. Bothnia dystrophy occurs mainly in the region Vsterbotten in Sweden, but the disease has also been identified in other parts of the world.
